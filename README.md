## What is it?

Onboarding processes can sometimes be overwhelming for new employees, with numerous tasks to complete, trainings to attend, and people to meet. Not all companies have a clear onboarding process or a dedicated coach to guide new hires effectively. To ensure employees are not left to navigate this alone and to provide a great experience, we created **OnBoard_D**. This dedicated AI assistant helps new employees get started by answering frequently asked questions and proactively notifying them of tasks they need to complete according to a specific onboarding plan set by the HR department.

### What are features:

- **Provide assistance with HR-related inquiries:** Address a wide range of questions that employees may have, including policies, benefits, procedures, and other human resources topics.

- **Summarize the current tasks assigned to employees:** Offer clear and concise summaries of tasks or responsibilities assigned to individuals, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding of their workload.

## What concepts it showcases?

Creating agents that tell jokes or generate cat images can be fun but not that useful in your work day-to-day life. We wanted to create something meaningfull and reusable enough to be used by any company on top of Microsoft 365 and leveraging AI where it is good at: understanding intents, analyzing amd summarizing stuff. Therefore, the OnBoard_DD solutions showcases the following:

- Integration with Microsoft 365 as part of an end-to-end solution, leveraging Teams, Planner and SharePoint.
- Sending proactive agent nofications to users.
- Handling agent authentication with both delegated (SSO) and application permissions (proactive notifiations) whithin Microsoft Teams and the Microsoft Graph API.
- Handling multiple tools whithin an agent performing different set of actions.
- Handling agent tool outputs and artifacts to display data in adaptive cards.
- Handling Human-In-The-Loop pattern in pair with the Bot Framework for sensitive actions, like POST requests initiated by tools.
